This repository contains a small OMOP CDM in a duckdb database. duckdb is a file based database similar to SQLite but with the benefit of a date type and a OLAP optimized design both of which are important for OMOP CDM data.

How to use this resource:

1. Download the file `synpuf1k.duckdb`
2. Connect to and query the CDM in R  

```{r}
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), "synpuf1k.duckdb")

dbListTables(con)

dbGetQuery(con, "select * from condition_occurrence limit 10")

dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
```

duckdb can be used in python, Java, C++, or from the command line. Check out the documentation at https://duckdb.org/docs/api/overview
